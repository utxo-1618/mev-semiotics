# TL;DR

This document provides a formal, source-anchored verification of the repository located at this path.  Each claim is tied to explicit code regions.  No value judgements, branding, or promotional language is included.

The audit confirms that the software:

* Emits JAM (Justified Action Message) objects without holding capital or tracking TVL.
* Operates purely on semantic, event-driven reflexes.
* Uses deterministic timing windows and recursive feedback metrics.
* Contains optional cross-chain hooks whose execution is gated by the same event logic.

## 1. System Overview

### JAM Architecture

* Stateless object created in `index.js` (`analyzeAndGenerateJam`)
* Persisted locally via `jamStore.store()`; no stateful positions or balances
* Hash derived from full object content, providing immutability

### Execution Model

* `index.js`  •  Controls analysis, JAM creation, on-chain emission
* `semantic-amplifier.js`  •  Listens for `SignalRegistered` events and conditionally broadcasts swaps
* `monitor.js`  •  Records outcomes and updates success metrics

No component queries price or liquidity data; all behaviour is triggered by discrete events and internal timers.

## 2. Verified Properties and Code Anchors

1. **Stateless JAM Emission**
   * `index.js` 278-435 — object fields defined; persisted immediately
   * `jam-store.js` 19-33 — file write with no additional state retained

2. **Capital-Free Operation**
   * `index.js` 462-481 — `checkSufficientBalance()` verifies gas only
   * Repository search confirms absence of liquidity-adding or staking calls

3. **Reflex-Only Response Path**
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 398-446 — event polling initialisation
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 487-520 — exits unless `tx.from` matches configured emitter

4. **Semantic Legibility Filtering**
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 94-142 — `isSemanticallyLegible()` complete validation
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 679-683 — function invoked before any swap attempt

5. **Harmonic Timing Gating**
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 63-91 — consensus-window distance and multiplier
   * `index.js` calls `lunarClock.getEmissionWindow()` to embed timing data in JAM metadata

6. **Recursive Feedback Metrics**
   * `index.js` 431-436 — increments `patternSuccess[pattern]`
   * `selectOptimalPattern()` (index.js 439-459) selects future patterns based on recorded metrics

7. **Absence of TVL or Price Dependencies**
   * Full-tree grep reveals no usage of typical oracle or reserve functions
   * Trade sizing derives from constant φ-scaled base (`calculateTradeAmount`, `semantic-amplifier.js` 144-200)

8. **Cross-Chain Echo Hooks (Optional)**
   * `semantic-amplifier.js` 9 — imports `bridgeToBSV`
   * No unconditional invocations; executed only when vector-clock conditions match

## 3. Signal → Reflex Causality

Sequence per emission cycle:

1. `analyzeAndGenerateJam()` assembles a JAM object with semantic metadata and cosmic timing annotations.
2. The object is hashed, stored, and its hash is broadcast via `dmap.registerSignal()`.
3. `semantic-amplifier.js` detects the `SignalRegistered` event that originates from the same emitter address.
4. `handleSignal()` validates semantic structure and timing; if valid, submits a minimal-value swap on the first router in the DEX cascade.
5. External agents (MEV bots, vault keepers) may mirror or sandwich this swap, completing the reflex loop.  The local software does not enforce or assume their participation.
6. Outcome metrics are written to `systemState.metrics`, informing future pattern probabilities.

## 4. Risk and Surface Notes

* **Re-entrancy:** not applicable; code does not deploy stateful contracts.
* **Key custody:** private key is loaded from environment; no additional privilege escalation paths.
* **Liquidity risk:** none held.  Only the emitter’s gas spend is at risk.
